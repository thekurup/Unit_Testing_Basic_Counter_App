# Flutter Unit Testing Basics Counter App

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental Flutter unit testing concepts using a simple Counter example. It serves as a practical introduction to test-driven development in Flutter, with a focus on proper test organization and lifecycle methods.

## 🧪 What's Inside

- Basic unit tests for a Counter class
- Proper test lifecycle implementation (setUp, tearDown, etc.)
- Test organization with groups
- Given-When-Then test pattern

## 📁 Project Structure

```
lib/
  ├── counter.dart            # Counter class implementation
  └── main.dart               # Main app file
test/
  └── counter_test.dart       # Unit tests for Counter class
```

## 🔍 The Counter Class

The Counter class is a simple implementation that:
- Starts with an initial count of 0
- Has methods to increment and decrement the counter
- Has a reset method to return the counter to 0

## 📚 Testing Concepts Covered

### 1. Test Organization

Tests are grouped logically using the `group()` function, making the test suite more readable and maintainable:

```dart
group("Counter Class", () {
  test("instantiate stage...", () { /* ... */ });
  test("when increment method is called", () { /* ... */ });
  test("decrement", () { /* ... */ });
});
```

### 2. Test Lifecycle Methods

The project demonstrates four key lifecycle methods:

- **setUp()**: Runs before each test, creating a fresh Counter instance
- **tearDown()**: Runs after each test, resetting the Counter
- **setUpAll()**: Runs once before all tests in a group or file
- **tearDownAll()**: Runs once after all tests in a group or file

This approach ensures test isolation and reduces code duplication.

### 3. Given-When-Then Pattern

Each test follows the Given-When-Then pattern (also known as Arrange-Act-Assert):

```dart
// Given (Arrange): A Counter instance is created in setUp()
// When (Act): We call a method like x.Increment()
// Then (Assert): We verify the expected outcome with expect()
expect(x.count, 1, reason: "The counter should be 1 after incrementing");
```

## 🚀 Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
flutter test
```

Or run individual test files:

```bash
flutter test test/counter_test.dart
```

## 🎓 Learning Points

This project demonstrates:

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test runs with a fresh environment
2. **DRY Principle**: Avoiding code duplication with setUp/tearDown
3. **Readable Tests**: Clear organization and descriptive test names
4. **Test Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for how the Counter class works
5. **Assertion Messages**: Using the reason parameter in expect() for clearer failures

## 📝 Notes for Beginners

- The test lifecycle flow is: `setUpAll` → [setUp → test → tearDown] (repeated for each test) → `tearDownAll`
- Always reset state between tests to ensure isolation
- Make test descriptions clear and descriptive
- Group related tests together
- Use appropriate matchers in your expect() statements

## 🔄 Test Lifecycle Flow

```
setUpAll()
  └── setUp()
      └── test("instantiate stage...")
      └── tearDown()
  └── setUp()
      └── test("when increment method is called")
      └── tearDown()
  └── setUp()
      └── test("decrement")
      └── tearDown()
tearDownAll()
```
